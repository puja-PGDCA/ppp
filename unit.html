Trees: Non-Linear data structure<br>
</b>
<br>
<i>
<br>A data structure is said to be linear if its elements form a sequence or a linear list. Previous
linear data structures that we have studied like an array, stacks, queues and linked lists organize 
data in linear order. A data structure is said to be non linear if its elements form a hierarchical 
classification where, data items appear at various levels.

<br>Trees and Graphs are widely used non-linear data structures. Tree and graph structures represent
hierarchical relationship between individual data elements. Graphs are nothing but trees with 
certain restrictions removed.
</i>
<br>Trees represent a special case of more general structures known as graphs. In a graph, there is no 
restrictions on the number of links that can enter or leave a node, and cycles may be present in the 
graph. The figure 5.1.1 shows a tree and a non-tree.

Tree is a popular data structure used in wide range of applications. A tree data structure can be 
defined as follows...<br>
<br>Tree is a non-linear data structure which organizes data in hierarchical structure and this is a 
recursive definition.
<p>
There is a specially designated node called the root. The remaining nodes are partitioned into n>=0 
disjoint sets T1, ..., Tn, where each of these sets is a tree. We call T1, ..., Tn are the subtrees of the 
root.
</p>

<p>A tree is hierarchical collection of nodes. One of the nodes, known as the root, is at the top of the 
hierarchy. Each node can have at most one link coming into it. The node where the link originates is 
called the parent node. The root node has no parent. The links leaving a node (any number of links 
are allowed) point to child nodes. Trees are recursive structures. Each child node is itself the root of 
a subtree. At the bottom of the tree are leaf nodes, which have no children.</p>
<b>Advantages of tree</b><br>
Trees are so useful and frequently used, because they have some very serious advantages:<br>
<ul>
<li>Trees reflect structural relationships in the data</li>
<li>Trees are used to represent hierarchies</li>
<li>Trees provide an efficient insertion and searching</li>
<li>Trees are very flexible data, allowing to move sub trees around with minimum effort</li>
</ul>
<b>Introduction Terminology</b>
<p>
In a Tree, Every individual element is called as Node. Node in a tree data structure, stores the actual 
data of that particular element and link to next element in hierarchical structure. Example

1.Root<br>
<p>In a tree data structure, the first node is called as Root Node. Every tree must have root node. We 
can say that root node is the origin of tree data structure. In any tree, there must be only one root 
node. We never have multiple root nodes in a tree. In above tree, A is a Root node</p>
2. Edge<br>
<p>In a tree data structure, the connecting link between any two nodes is called as EDGE. In a tree with 
'N' number of nodes there will be a maximum of 'N-1' number of edges.</p>
3. Parent<br>
<p>In a tree data structure, the node which is predecessor of any node is called as PARENT NODE. In 
simple words, the node which has branch from it to any other node is called as parent node. Parent 
node can also be defined as "The node which has child / children". e.g., Parent (A,B,C,D).</p>
4. Child<br>
<p>In a tree data structure, the node which is descendant of any node is called as CHILD Node. In 
simple words, the node which has a link from its parent node is called as child node. In a tree, any 
parent node can have any number of child nodes. In a tree, all the nodes except root are child nodes.
e.g., Children of D are (H, I,J).</p>
5. Siblings<br>
<p>In a tree data structure, nodes which belong to same Parent are called as SIBLINGS. In simple 
words, the nodes with same parent are called as Sibling nodes. Ex: Siblings (B,C, D)</p>
6. Leaf<br>
<p>In a tree data structure, the node which does not have a child (or) node with degree zero is called 
as LEAF Node. In simple words, a leaf is a node with no child.
In a tree data structure, the leaf nodes are also called as External Nodes. External node is also a node 
with no child. In a tree, leaf node is also called as 'Terminal' node. Ex: (K,L,F,G,M,I,J)</p>
7. Internal Nodes<br>
<p>In a tree data structure, the node which has atleast one child is called as INTERNAL Node. In simple 
words, an internal node is a node with atleast one child.
In a tree data structure, nodes other than leaf nodes are called as Internal Nodes. The root node is 
also said to be Internal Node if the tree has more than one node. Internal nodes are also called as 
'Non-Terminal' nodes. Ex:B,C,D,E,H</p>
8. Degree<br>
<p>In a tree data structure, the total number of children of a node (or)number of subtrees of a node is 
called as DEGREE of that Node. In simple words, the Degree of a node is total number of children it 
has. The highest degree of a node among all the nodes in a tree is called as 'Degree of Tree'</p>

9. Level<br>
<p>In a tree data structure, the root node is said to be at Level 0 and the children of root node are at 
Level 1 and the children of the nodes which are at Level 1 will be at Level 2 and so on... In simple 
words, in a tree each step from top to bottom is called as a Level and the Level count starts with '0' 
and incremented by one at each level (Step). Some authors start root level with 1.</p>
10. Height<br>
<p>In a tree data structure, the total number of edges from leaf node to a particular node in the longest 
path is called as HEIGHT of that Node. In a tree, height of the root node is said to be height of the 
tree. In a tree, height of all leaf nodes is '0'.</p>
11. Depth<br>
<p>In a tree data structure, the total number of edges from root node to a particular node is called 
as DEPTH of that Node. In a tree, the total number of edges from root node to a leaf node in the 
longest path is said to be Depth of the tree. In simple words, the highest depth of any leaf node in a 
tree is said to be depth of that tree. In a tree, depth of the root node is '0'.</p>
12. Path<br>
<p>In a tree data structure, the sequence of Nodes and Edges from one node to another node is called 
as PATH between that two Nodes. Length of a Path is total number of nodes in that path. In below 
example the path A - B - E - J has length 4.</p>

13. Sub Tree<br>
<p>In a tree data structure, each child from a node forms a subtree recursively. Every child node will 
form a subtree on its parent node.</p>

<b>Tree Representations</b><br>
A tree data structure can be represented in two methods. Those methods are as follows...<br>
1.List Representation<br>
2. Left Child - Right Sibling Representation<br>
Consider the following tree...<br>
